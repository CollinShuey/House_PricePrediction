ML model to predict house prices using the Sci-kit Learn library. 

# Description
* Trained a machine learning model using the Sci-kit learn library along with Pandas and NumPy libraries, to take a
spreadsheet of housing data and predict house prices
* Created a feature to track bedrooms per house to enrich the data set with relevant information to improve accuracy
* Established a data preprocessing pipeline using Sci-kit learnâ€™s Pipeline and combined numerical and categorical
feature transformations to streamline the model training process. Went on to train and test the data and employed
cross-validation techniques with 5 folds to assess the models score.
* Evaluated model using R-square metric and Mean squared error and got an MSE of $476 and average R-square of .99
indicating a near-perfect fit
